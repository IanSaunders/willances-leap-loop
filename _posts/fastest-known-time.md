### **What is an FKT?**


An FKT, or Fastest Known Time, refers to the fastest time that a specified route or distance has been completed by an individual or a team. This concept is popular in trail running, ultrarunning, and mountain running, where conventional races might not always be feasible due to the length, remoteness, or uniqueness of the course. FKTs provide a way for runners to challenge themselves and others on specific segments of trails or routes, often in natural and scenic settings. Unlike traditional races, FKT attempts are usually self-supported, without the formalities of organized events, allowing runners to attempt these records at their convenience. The appeal of FKTs lies in their mix of endurance, strategy, and exploration, as runners not only strive to set new records but also connect deeply with the landscapes they traverse.
